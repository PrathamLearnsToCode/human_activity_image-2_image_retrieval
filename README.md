# human_activity_image-2_image_retrieval

The task is for image-to-image retrieval, which involves finding similar images in a gallery when given a specific image as a query. To be more precise,
I created a system that ranks a given gallery of images according to their similarity to the query image. The dataset comprises images depicting various human actions like "hugging,"
"bicycling," "eating," and more. So, for instance, if I have a query image showing someone "eating," my neural network-based model should rank the gallery images in such a way that all
images of people "eating" are among the top-ranked results.
